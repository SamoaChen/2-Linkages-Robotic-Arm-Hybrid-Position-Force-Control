# Robotic Arm Hybrid Position Force Control

* This is a robotic project built during quarantine time without using 3D printer or laser cutter, the body of the arm is made purely out of stacked cardboard
* This project achieved a centralized hybrid position force control on a 2 linkages robotic arm
* The robotic arm system also integrated self calibrating and angle overshoot proof mechanisms
