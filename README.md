# Robotic Arm Hybrid Position Force Control
![Robotic Arm](https://github.com/SamoaChen/2-Linkages-Robotic-Arm-Hybrid-Position-Force-Control/blob/master/images/Arm_Display_Final_with_Curtain_edited.jpg)
* This is a robotic project built during quarantine time without using 3D printer or laser cutter, the body of the arm is made purely out of stacked cardboard
* This project achieved a position control on a 2 linkages robotic arm 
* This project achieved a centralized hybrid position force control on a 2 linkages robotic arm
* The robotic arm system also integrated self calibrating and angle overshoot proof mechanisms

# Main equipments and material used
* Arduino Uno 
* Raspberry Pi 3b+
* 2x geared motor with encoder
* Lever switches 
* Force sensitive resistor
* L298N motor driver 
* Regular cardboard
* Epoxy
