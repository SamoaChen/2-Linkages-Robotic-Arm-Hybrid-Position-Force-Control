# Robotic Arm Hybrid Position Force Control
<Robotic_Arm src="https://your-image-url.type" width="100" height="100">
* This is a robotic project built during quarantine time without using 3D printer or laser cutter, the body of the arm is made purely out of stacked cardboard
* This project achieved a centralized hybrid position force control on a 2 linkages robotic arm
* The robotic arm system also integrated self calibrating and angle overshoot proof mechanisms
